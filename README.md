# Galaxies

Variant application based on work done for the Particles project, visualizing massless stars orbiting gravitating black holes. We do not provide official support for this repository but present it as-is to the community to reference building applications with Leap Motion.

Also be sure to check out our [Unity Modules][unitymodules], which is the backbone of this application and Leap Motion support for Unity!
